# Cancer Detection with Keras

This notebook explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify malignant cancers in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. The data is provide by Kaggle as a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset.

Find the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder. The notebook is intended to be run in Kaggle's cloud notebook environment. I recommend enabling the GPU P100 accelerator.
